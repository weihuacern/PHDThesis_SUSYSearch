\chapter{Conclusions}

A search for stop and gluino in hadronic channle with customized top tagger using $35.9 fb^{-1}$ of pp collisions at ps = 13TeV recorded in 2016 with the CMS detector
at the CERN LHC has been presented. The standard model backgrounds are estimated using data-driven methods as well as MC simulation. No excess of events above the expected standard model background is observed. The result is interpreted in the context of simplified supersymmetric models as limits on the cross section of the gluino and stop pair production processes. The T2tt model has been excluded with the stop mass up to 1020 GeV. The gluino mass exclusions are up to 1810-2040 GeV, depending on the type of models. The naturalness of the SUSY MSSM RPC simplified models are under challenging with the high exclusion stop and gluino masses in simplified models.
