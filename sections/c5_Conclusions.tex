\chapter{Conclusions}

A search for top squarks and gluinos in all-hadronic events produced in proton-proton collisions at center-of-mass energy 13 TeV has been presented. The data sample, collected in 2016 with the CMS detector at the CERN large hadron collider (LHC), corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 $fb^{-1}$.

The standard model backgrounds are estimated using data-driven methods as well as MC simulation. No excess of events above the expected standard model background is observed. The result is interpreted in the context of simplified supersymmetric models as 95\% confidence level upper limits on the cross section of gluinos and top squarks pair production processes. The T2tt model has been excluded for top squark masses up to 1020 GeV. The corresponding exclusions on the gluino mass are up to 1810-2040 GeV, depending on the type of models. The naturalness of the SUSY MSSM RPC simplified models are under challenge with large 13 TeV data samples now being collected at the LHC.
