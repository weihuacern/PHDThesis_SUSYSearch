\section{Background Estimation}

The standard model processes are suppressed after the baseline cut, and signal sensitivities are optimized through search bin design. However, there are still irreducible standard model backgrounds in the search region. In this analysis, the events from \ttbar, $W$+jets and single top is the major background. $Z$+jets, QCD and other rare processes also have contribution in some search bins that cannot be ignored. The simulation backgrounds distributions are showed in the Fig~\ref{fig:c4bgmcpie} in the \ntops and \nbjets categories.

\subsection{Backgrounds from top and W decays}
The background from \ttbar, $W$+jets and single-top events which are not removed by the explicit lepton-veto and isolated track veto cuts are the largest background in the analysis. It can contain either a hadronically decaying tau or light leptons (electrons or muons) which are not isolated, not identified/reconstructed or are out of the acceptance region. Both types of the background are estimated using the "translation factor method" (described in this section). The classic lost lepton method which is used to predict specifically the events with light leptons will be discussed in the next section which serves as an important cross-check to the translation factor method.
