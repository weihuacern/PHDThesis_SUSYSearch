The hadronic decay of $\tau$ leptons (\tauh) is one of the largest components 
of the background from \ttbar , $W$+jets and single-top events contributing to the 
search regions. With respect to the Run 1 analysis, the 2015 version 
described in this note incorporates a veto on isolated tracks to reduce
the hadronic $\tau$ background while sustaining a minimal 
impact on signal efficiency. After applying the veto, the remnant hadronic
$\tau$ events are estimated using the method described in the succeeding
sections. 

\subsubsection{Tau response function method}
\label{sec:tauresponse}

When a $W$ boson decays to a neutrino and a hadronically decaying 
$\tau$ lepton ($\tauh$), the presence of neutrinos in the final state 
results in \MET, and the event passes the lepton veto because the 
hadronically decaying $\tau$ is reconstructed as a jet. 
This background is estimated from a control sample (CS) of $\mu$\,+\,jets 
events selected from data using a $\mu+\HT$-based trigger, 
HLT\_Mu15\_IsoVVVL\_PFHT350\_v, and requiring exactly one 
$\mu$ with $p_{T}^{\mu}>20 GeV$ and $|\eta|<2.4$.
A cut on the transverse mass of the $W$, 
$m_\mathrm{T}=\sqrt{2p_{T}^{\mu}\MET(1-\cos\Delta\phi)}<$ 100 GeV, 
is required in order 
to select events containing a $W\to\mu\nu$ decay and to suppress 
possible new physics signal contamination, i.e., signal events
present in the $\mu$\,+\,jets sample. Here,
$\Delta\phi$ is the azimuthal angle between the $\vec{p_{T}}^\mu$ and the 
\MET directions.
Because the $\mu$\,+\,jets and \tauh{}\,+\,jets events arise from the same 
physics processes, the hadronic component of the two samples is the same 
except for the response of the detector to the muon or the $\tauh$ jet. 
The trick consists of replacing the muon $p_{T}$ by a random sample of a
simulated \tauh jet response ``template'' function for a 
hadronically-decaying $\tau$ lepton. The 
global variables of the event are recalculated with this $\tauh$ jet, and the 
search selections are applied to predict the \tauh background.

As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:templates}, the template is measured in
four $p_{T}$ bins to account for the $p_{T}$ dependence of $\tau$ jet response.
